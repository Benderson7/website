            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I grew up in the Northern Chicagoland area, and moved to Boston for university. I am completing my
                undergraduate at Northeastern, and with the help of my Computer Science degree, want to go into software
                development.
                A lot of my time spent outside of schoolwork is playing with music ensembles on campus, and I hope to
                continue performing even after school is done. Other than that, I really enjoy tabletop and video games,
                longboarding around the city, and camping.</p>

                <p>After school, I plan to explore a career in software development. I haven't quite made a decision on
                    the specific area, but I know I will create easy-to-use software that makes a difference.</p>

                <p>I have always had a found a hobby in video games, and this has recently extended to tabletop games as
                    well - some of my strongest friends have been made through gaming. I love analyzing game mechanics,
                    and would jump at any opportunity to help design a game.</p>

                <p>I am grateful for being able to spend my first summer after joining university helping make memories
                    as a
